## Agenda

- Warm Up
- Probability Distribution Reading Recap
- Concept questions: Probability Distributions
- PS 4: Probability Distributions

# Warm Up

Recall the complement rule $P(B^c) = 1-P(B)$

- What is the probability that two people in a class of 9 people share a birthday?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(7, top = 0)
```

You are welcome to work together. Write out the problem on the board when you are done.

 Consider the box of tickets shown below. 
 
![](images/box-slides-cq-feb-22-2023.png){fig-align=center width="500"} 
 
 The plots below show:
 
1. The probability histogram for the value of a ticket drawn at random from the box
2. An empirical histogram for which the data were generated by drawing **10** tickets from the box with replacement 
3. An empirical histogram for which the data were generated by drawing **100** tickets from the box with replacement
4. An empirical histogram generated by **20** draws from a different box. 


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
box <-  c(rep(0,4), 3,3,5,6,7,7)
set.seed(12345)

p1 <- data.frame(box) %>%
   group_by(box) %>% 
   summarise(probs = n()/10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(box), y = probs)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.98, fill = "deeppink3") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("box tickets") +
  ylab("") + 
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = 0.35, label = "(B)", size = 5) +
  ylim(c(0,0.4))

samp1 <- sample(box,10, replace = TRUE )

p2 <- data.frame(samp1) %>%

box2 <- c(0,0,0,3,5,5,6,6,7,7)

set.seed(12345)
samp3 <- sample(box2, 20, replace = TRUE )

  ylim(c(0,0.4))

(p4 + p1)/(p3 + p2)
```

If it's neither, what is the term we use to describe it?

Does the quantity described below have a probability distribution that is binomial (if so, what are $n$ and $p$?), hypergeometric (if so , what are $N$, $G$, and $n$?), or neither (why)?

\

Roll a fair ten-sided die 20 times. We count the number of times we roll a multiple of 3.

Binomial(20, 3/10). The pollev will have 4 choices, and then figuring out the parameters can be a classroom discussion. The fourth choice is "Need more info"

YouGov surveyed 1,500 adult US citizens last December and counted the number of respondents who had read at least one book in 2023. The population of the US is about 335 million.

Binomial, hypergeometric, or neither?

:::{.notes}
Hypergeometric($N = 335$ mill,  $n = 1500$, G), where G is not known, being the number of people who have read at least one book. Can remark that we could use the binomial to model this rather than HG, and that we will discuss sample surveys in this unit. Disturbingly, only 54% of respondents had read at least one book.

Are we describing a probability distribution below that is binomial? Or is it hypergeometric? Or do neither apply?

\

A six-sided die is tossed twice, and we check if the sum of the spots is 8 or not.

Binomial, with $n = 1, p = 5/36$ or Bernoulli with $p = 5/36$.
