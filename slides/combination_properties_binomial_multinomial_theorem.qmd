## Combination Properties 1

1.  If choosing a single item out of $n$ possibilities, you have $n$ combinations.

$$
{n \choose 1} = n
$$ 

## Combination Properties 2

2. If you have $n$ possibilities and are choosing $n$ items, you have $1$ combination.

$$
{n \choose n} = 1
$$

## Combination Properties 3

3. Special $r$ chosen first

$$
{n \choose r} = {n \choose n - r}
$$


$$
{n \choose r} = {n-1 \choose r} + {n-1 \choose r-1}, \quad 1\leq r \leq n 
$$ 

## Concept Q 1

Prove that

$$
{n \choose n} = 1
$$

using the combination formula

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}
$$

## Binomial Theorem

Think about license plates that are formed by $n$ digits, where each digit can be **either** a letter or a number. $a = 26, b = 10$.

Total number of distinct plates:

$$
N = (a + b)^n = N_0 + N_1 + \cdots + N_n,
$$

where $N_k$ is the number of distinct plates that contains exactly $k$ number of letters.

$$
N_k = {n \choose k} \times a^k \times b^{n-k}
$$

## Concept Q2: Binomial Theorem

You are forming a 3 person committee of faculty or students. You can choose from 4 students and 3 faculty:

$$
N = (a + b)^n = N_0 + N_1 + \cdots + N_n,
$$

where $N_k$ is the # of distinct committees with exactly $k$ students.


```{r}

```

$$
N_k = {n \choose k} \times a^k \times b^{n-k}
$$

What are $n$, $a$, and $b$ in this case? Solve the problem using the $N_k$ formula. When finished, **compare with a neighbor**


## Multinomial Coefficient

A set of $n$ distinct items is to be divided into $r$ distinct groups of respective sizes 
$n_1, \ldots, n_r$, where $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_r = n$


Number of possible divisions is

$$
{n \choose n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2! \cdots n_r!}
$$

$$
{n \choose n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r} = {n \choose n_1}{n-n_1 \choose n_2}{n-n_1-n_2 \choose n_3}\cdots{n_r \choose n_r}
$$

## Concept Q3: Multinomial Theorem


$$
(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_r)^n = \sum_{n_1 + \cdots + n_r = n} {n \choose n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r} a_1^{n_1} a_2^{n_2} \cdots a_r^{n_r}
$$
$$
{n \choose n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r} = {n \choose n_1}{n-n_1 \choose n_2}{n-n_1-n_2 \choose n_3}\cdots{n_r \choose n_r}
$$

You have 15 faculty. You need 8 faculty on AAC, 5 faculty on ACM and 2 faculty on Campus Sustainability Committee. How many possible combinations do you have?
