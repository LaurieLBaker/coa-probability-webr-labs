**Combinations** and **permutations** are two fundamental concepts in probability and combinatorics that deal with the selection and arrangement of objects.

### Key Differences Between Combinations and Permutations

1.  **Definition**:
    -   **Permutations** refer to the different ways in which a set of objects can be arranged, where the order *does* matter.
    -   **Combinations** refer to the different ways in which a set of objects can be selected, where the order *does not* matter.
2.  **Formula**:
    -   **Permutations Formula**:\
        The number of permutations of ( r ) objects from a total of ( n ) objects is given by: \[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \] Here, ( n! ) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to ( n ), and ((n - r)!) accounts for the objects that are not chosen.

    -   **Combinations Formula**:\
        The number of combinations of ( r ) objects from a total of ( n ) objects is given by: \[ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r! \cdot (n - r)!} \] Here, ( r! ) accounts for the fact that the order in which the ( r ) objects are chosen does not matter.
3.  **Order Matters**:
    -   **Permutations**: The order of selection is important.\
        For example, if you are arranging 3 books on a shelf, the sequence in which they are placed matters (`Book A, Book B, Book C` is different from `Book C, Book A, Book B`).
    -   **Combinations**: The order of selection is not important.\
        For example, if you are forming a committee of 3 members out of 5 people, the sequence in which you pick the members does not matter (`Alice, Bob, Charlie` is the same as `Charlie, Alice, Bob`).
4.  **Use Cases**:
    -   **Permutations** are used when we need to determine the number of possible arrangements of a set of items where their order matters (e.g., seating arrangements, race rankings).
    -   **Combinations** are used when we need to determine the number of ways to select items from a set where their order does not matter (e.g., lottery numbers, selecting a team).

### Examples

1.  **Permutations Example**: You have 4 students and you want to arrange them in a line for a photo. How many different ways can this be done?
    -   Since the order matters, this is a permutation problem.
    -   The answer is ( P(4, 4) = 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 ).
2.  **Combinations Example**: You have 4 students and you want to select 2 of them to form a committee. How many ways can you do this?
    -   Since the order does not matter, this is a combination problem.
    -   The answer is ( C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot (4 - 2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 ).

### Summary

-   **Permutations** = Selection with arrangement (order matters).
-   **Combinations** = Selection without arrangement (order does not matter).

Understanding whether the order is important or not is key to distinguishing between a combination and a permutation.
