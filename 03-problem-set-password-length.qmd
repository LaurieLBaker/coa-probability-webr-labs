### Exercise: Exploring Password Strength

#### Objective

Understand why longer passwords are generally more secure than shorter ones by calculating the number of possible combinations for passwords of different lengths.

#### Background Information

A password made up of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers has a total of 62 possible characters (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 digits).

#### Instructions

1. **Calculate the Number of Possible Combinations**

   For a password of length \( L \), the total number of possible combinations is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 62^L
   \]
   where 62 is the total number of possible characters and \( L \) is the length of the password.

2. **Activity**

   a. **Short Password Example (Length 4)**

   Calculate the number of possible combinations for a 4-character password.
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 62^4
   \]

   b. **Medium Password Example (Length 8)**

   Calculate the number of possible combinations for an 8-character password.
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 62^8
   \]

   c. **Long Password Example (Length 12)**

   Calculate the number of possible combinations for a 12-character password.
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 62^{12}
   \]

3. **Compare the Results**

   Use a calculator or a computational tool to find the actual numbers for each case. Here are the approximate results:
   
   - For a 4-character password: \( 62^4 \approx 14,776,336 \) combinations
   - For an 8-character password: \( 62^8 \approx 218,340,105,584,896 \) combinations
   - For a 12-character password: \( 62^{12} \approx 3,226,586,539,664,432,000 \) combinations

4. **Discussion**

   a. **Compare and Contrast**:
      - Observe the difference in the number of possible combinations as the length of the password increases.
      - Discuss how the increase in possible combinations makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the password through brute-force methods.

   b. **Understand the Implication**:
      - Explain how a longer password exponentially increases the number of potential combinations, making it exponentially harder to crack.
      - Consider real-world scenarios where the strength of a password could impact security, such as in protecting personal accounts or sensitive information.

5. **Homework**

   How would adding additional factors such as including special characters in the password affect the password strength? Make a plot for varying password lengths to compare the strength of the password.
