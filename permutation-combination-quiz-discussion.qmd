### Questions: Permutation or Combination?

1. **Student Club Officers:**
   A student club needs to elect a president, vice president, and secretary from a group of 7 members. In how many ways can these three officers be chosen?

2. **Selecting a Research Team:**
   A professor wants to choose 4 students out of 10 to join her research team. In how many ways can the students be selected?

3. **Forming a Study Group:**
   A group of 5 students wants to form a study group, but they will sit in a specific order around a round table. How many different seating arrangements are possible?

4. **Assigning Dorm Rooms:**
   10 students are applying for 5 single rooms in a dormitory. The rooms are identical. In how many ways can 5 students be assigned a room?

5. **Choosing Books for a Course:**
   A literature professor needs to select 3 books out of 8 for a course syllabus. The order in which the books are read does not matter. How many different selections are possible?

6. **Organizing a Science Fair:**
   In a science fair, 6 projects are submitted. Three prizes will be awarded: first place, second place, and third place. In how many ways can the three prizes be awarded?

7. **Scheduling Speakers for a Conference:**
   A conference organizer needs to schedule 4 speakers for different time slots throughout the day. In how many ways can the organizer schedule the speakers?

8. **Forming a Mixed Committee:**
   A new committee is to be formed with 2 faculty members and 3 students from a pool of 6 faculty members and 8 students. How many different committees can be formed?

9. **Choosing Seats in a Classroom:**
   In a class, there are 20 students and 5 available seats in the front row. In how many ways can 5 students be chosen to sit in those seats?

10. **Arranging Books on a Shelf:**
    A student has 7 different books and wants to arrange them on a shelf. In how many different ways can the books be arranged?

### Answers: Identify the Problem Type

1. **Permutation** - The order of selection matters (President, Vice President, Secretary).
2. **Combination** - The order does not matter; it's just selecting 4 out of 10 students.
3. **Permutation** - The order of seating around the table matters.
4. **Combination** - The rooms are identical, so only the choice of 5 students matters, not the order.
5. **Combination** - Selecting 3 books from 8 without concern for order.
6. **Permutation** - The order of prizes (first, second, third) matters.
7. **Permutation** - Scheduling for different time slots means the order matters.
8. **Combination** - Forming a committee where order of selection doesn't matter.
9. **Combination** - Selecting 5 students out of 20, assuming seats themselves are not distinguishable.
10. **Permutation** - Arranging books on a shelf where the order matters.
